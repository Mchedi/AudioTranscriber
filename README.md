# AudioTranscriber

AudioTranscriber is an end-to-end audio-to-text transcription service. This project features a React-based frontend for uploading audio files and viewing transcriptions, as well as a Python-based backend that processes the audio. An optional Spring Boot backend is also available if you prefer a Java-based solution.

1.## Overview

AudioTranscriber converts speech in audio files into text. The React frontend allows users to upload an audio file, and the backend processes it to return the transcription.

2.## Features

Audio Upload: Easily upload audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.).
Real-Time Transcription: View transcribed text generated by the backend.
Multiple Backend Options: Use the Python transcription script or switch to a Spring Boot backend.
Modern UI: Built with React for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

3.## Tech Stack

Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Backend (Primary): Python (for transcription using libraries such as Whisper)
Optional Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
